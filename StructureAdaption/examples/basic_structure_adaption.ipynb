We begin by defining the layers we want to add and attach them to the layer we want to insert them after. Then we provide the layer we want to connect them to again, without doing anything to it. We specify that we want to `insert_sequentially=True` and grow the network. Again all the weights are preserved. If weights may not match while inserting, because e.g. the input shape for a layer changes we can specify `skip_mismatch=True` in order to ignore these mismatches and initialize the layer with its own initializer. Again we provide `None` for the optimizer."
